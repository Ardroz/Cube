Cube
====

Cube is a weird idea from two guys, originally, from @danblack13 and supported by @Alevardi.
The idea:
Create an encryption algorythm based on the funny and classic rubik's cube. (3x3x3).
we are working hard on it and by now, we've a very fully functional console cube, you can display it
on your terminal by compiling and running "SolveCube.java" file, we manage it by id's for every single cubie.

it's kind of the basic idea we have, it isn't like the next rubik emulator awesomeness because it is NOT meant to 
be it, so we probabilly wont add usable stuff such as multiple moves, etc(feel free to add it).
We are heading it to the encryption stuff  at this moment.
